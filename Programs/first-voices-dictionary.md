##Background Info
FirstVoices Dictionary is an online application supporting the language documentation and revitalization initiatives of the First Peoples’ Cultural Foundation, managed by the First Peoples’ Cultural Council (FPCC). The FPCC's language repository, with over 70 First Nations languages is in need of modern revitalization in order to better meet the current web needs of a wide variety of stakeholders. The online application being built will seek to improve data collection, data storage, reusability and the delivery of educational resources online.
