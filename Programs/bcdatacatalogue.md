##Background Info
The BC Data Catalogue (BCDC) provides information about (metadata), and access to  more than 3500 government datasets, web services (APIs) and online applications, including more than 1500 datasets licensed for commercial use under the Open Government License of BC.    The system provides both a web interface and APIs to help users search, understand and use datasets, web services (APIs) and online applications.    
 
The open source code the province manages to power the system is available on GiHub. The system is based on the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network ( CKAN )  open source software project initiated by the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF).   Over the next few months we are working to evolve our software development lifecycle (SDLC) to an open methodology that will share our development backlog.
