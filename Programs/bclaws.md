##Long term plans
The Queen's Printer is currently exploring the possibility of partnering with municipal jurisdictions to leverage the tools already created for the provincial platform. This would allow a common interface to citizens under a common legislative schema for all legislative data that pertains to them municipally and provincially. It would also allow companies that use the BCLaws API to rapidly redeploy their work onto the municipal level.

##Collaborate
Opportunity for Schema Developer to research the nuances of bylaw information in commonwealth jurisdictions and capture these nuances within a municipal namespace then integrate this content into the current provincial regulation and statute schema structure.

##Background Info
BC Laws is a new platform developed by the Queen's Printer of British Columbia for creating and interacting with highly structured documents.
BC Laws is the British Columbia government portal for accessing BC provincial legislation. Traditionally jurisdictions have created  legislative information online using standard word processing tools and accessed that content through traditional web methods using html or pdf. BC Laws is an attempt to modernize this process.
 
Custom drafting tools have been created to allow legislative drafters to create feature rich content in machine consumable format, XML. This information in then published online through an Application Programmer Interface (API) that allows granular access and reporting on this legislative content. Building on this access to legislation all content has been released under a permissive license encouraging citizens and companies to create new value added services for citizen legislative access.
