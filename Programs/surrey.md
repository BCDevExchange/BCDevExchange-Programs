##Long term plans
The Surrey Open Data Program is one component of our commitment to be an open, transparent and accessible government.  Open Data is the idea that certain data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions.  The goal of open data is to:
 
- Empower citizens 
- Help small businesses 
- Enable socio-economic development (health care, education, economic productivity, and scientific research), which is accelerated by better access to data
- Create value in some other positive unforeseen way
- See more [here](http://www.surrey.ca/city-services/658.aspx#sthash.gx1TbvzS.dpuf)
